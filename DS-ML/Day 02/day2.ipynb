    "Data Scaling aka Feature scaling is a method used to standardize the range of independent variables or features of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why to scale the features?\n",
    "Since the range of values of raw data varies widely, in some machine learning algorithms, objective functions will not work properly without normalization. For example, the majority of classifiers calculate the distance between two points by the Euclidean distance. If one of the features has a broad range of values, the distance will be governed by this particular feature. Therefore, the range of all features should be normalized so that each feature contributes approximately proportionately to the final distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another reason why feature scaling is applied is that gradient descent converges much faster with feature scaling than without it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most 3 popular feature scaling methods are described below:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rescaling\n",
    "It is commonly known as min-max scaling. It is the simplest method and consists in rescaling the range of features to scale the range in [0, 1] or [−1, 1]. Selecting the target range depends on the nature of the data. The general formula is given as:\n",
    "\n",
    "${\\displaystyle x'={\\frac {x-{\\text{min}}(x)}{{\\text{max}}(x)-{\\text{min}}(x)}}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where ${\\displaystyle x}$ is an original value, ${\\displaystyle x'}$ is the rescaled value. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mean Normalization\n",
    "The point of normalization is to change your observations so that they can be described as a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normal distribution (Gaussian distribution), also known as the bell curve, is a specific statistical distribution where a roughly equal observations fall above and below the mean, the mean and the median are the same, and there are more observations closer to the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general formula is given as:\n",
    "\n",
    "${\\displaystyle x'={\\frac {x-{\\text{mean}}(x)}{{\\text{max}}(x)-{\\text{min}}(x)}}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where ${\\displaystyle x}$ is an original value, ${\\displaystyle x'}$ is the normalized value. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Standardization\n",
    "Standardization transforms your data such that the resulting distribution has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general method of calculation is to determine the distribution mean and standard deviation for each feature. Next we subtract the mean from each feature. Then we divide the values (mean is already subtracted) of each feature by its standard deviation.\n",
