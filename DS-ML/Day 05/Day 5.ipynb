They would then insert the predictions back into the data warehouse/SQL tables for your company. After that, a software engineer and UI/UX designer will display the predictions into a user interface — if necessary. As you can see, the whole process from business problem to solution in a visible, easy to use format, is not just the responsibility of a data scientist (however, yes, some data scientists can do all x amount of roles)."

For instance, let’s say you want to predict the revenue of a store from different inputs (day of the week, advertising, promotion). Then your model will be trained on historical data and use them to forecast future revenues. Hence the model is **supervised**, it knows what to learn. Supervised learning includes regression and classification problems.\n",
